'''A hashing algorithm is a complex mathemtical function that transforms input data into an ouput string of fixed length.
The same input string will always produce the same output string. We can not go backwards, only forward with hashing.
Instead of storing an actual password in a database, the actual hash is stored in the DB. We can add a layer of hardening with salting.
Salting are short random set of characters appeneded to a users password before they're hashed. The user wont know a salt is being used.
Salts are generally sotred in plaintxt along with the hash output. Finally, there are peppers. A pepper is a short random string or charaacter.
A pepper is specifically something not stored in the database, pheraabs in the application code or a secure memory enclave.'''
